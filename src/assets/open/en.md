### Data
The term *data* generally refers to descriptions of concrete circumstances, observations (facts), or points in time. 
When we use the term in the context of digital technologies, we often want to *evaluate* the data, i.e., we are mostly
interested in numerical descriptions with extensive details.

We want to know not only whether there are apple trees in a meadow or not, but how many of which variety, how big, when planted, how productive ... This would give us a small data table already:

| Variety | Height [m] | Planting date | Yield [kg] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Boskop | 3 | 01.02.1990 | 7 | 
| Eslter | 4 | 02.03.1991 | 11 | 
| Unknown | 2 | Unknown | 6 | 

It is very easy to provide this tabular form to a computer for processing and display.

We could also derive this information from an image. Still, we wouldn't probaly count a photo as data yet. It does not directly contain the information about the number of apple trees. We have to count them. Each time we see the picture and each person who sees the picture. Similarly with other representations of data, such as reports and infographics.

Reports are no data

Tables are machine readable. Images and reports are not.

On the other hand we can **digitize** images, texts and many other objects and process the data with computers. This enables many new use-cases. Some are effort-hungry and expensive. Not all of them are beneficial for the general public.

Getting the number of trees from the table is a quick and simple process for our computer. Getting the number of trees from the digitized image is complicated, time-consuming and still error-prone.

### Open Data
According to a definition on [Codefor.de](https://codefor.de/ziele/#heading-01-open-data) *Open data* are

> ... Data that can be freely accessed, used and shared by all. They are generated and collected in many applications, such as official measurements or scientific experiments.

A good guideline for publication is provided by the [**FAIR**](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles. Minimum requirements would be:

  * published under a free license, e.g., [CC licenses](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/)
  * machine-readable in an exchangeable format. Tables e.g. in CSV or JSON, map data as GeoJSON.
  * Metadata containing information about content, provenance, and other characteristics.

Personal data is usually **not** open data.
