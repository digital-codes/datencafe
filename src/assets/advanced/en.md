### Where to go from here?

In the following we list some topics relevant once you have developed certain data-literacy skills. More to come, stay tuned.

### Open Source Data Tools

Open source data science tools like R, Knime, and others have revolutionized the field of data science by providing cost-effective and customizable solutions for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. These tools offer a wide range of functionalities and capabilities, making them suitable for diverse data science applications. For instance, R, a popular programming language for statistical computing, provides an extensive library of statistical and graphical techniques for data analysis and visualization. Knime, a data analytics platform, enables the integration of diverse data sources and provides a user-friendly interface for building data pipelines and workflows. These open source data science tools provide a flexible and scalable environment for data scientists to experiment, prototype, and develop solutions to real-world problems, making them indispensable for modern data science.

### Data APIs

Data APIs provide a programmatic way to access and manipulate data from web applications, databases, and other sources, making it easier for data scientists to integrate and use the data in their applications. The benefits of data APIs over simple HTML access are numerous. Firstly, APIs provide a standard way to access data, making it easier to automate and streamline data retrieval and processing. Secondly, APIs allow for real-time data updates and notifications, ensuring that the data is always up-to-date. Additionally, APIs provide more secure and controlled access to data, allowing data owners to control how their data is accessed and used. Overall, data APIs offer a more efficient and effective means of accessing and using data, making them an indispensable tool for modern data science.

### Linked Open Data

Linked Open Data (LOD) is a practice of publishing structured data using open standards to enable easy sharing and reuse of information across different applications and domains. The benefits of LOD are numerous, making it an essential tool for data scientists. Firstly, LOD promotes data interoperability and integration, enabling the integration of heterogeneous data from different sources. This integration enhances data discovery and reuse, promoting data-driven decision-making. Secondly, LOD improves the accessibility of data, making it easier to locate and use data. Finally, LOD facilitates data sharing and collaboration among different communities, leading to the creation of new knowledge and innovation. In summary, LOD provides a powerful means to manage and use data effectively, leading to improved efficiency and innovation in data science.

### 5-Star LoD Schemas

A 5-star linked data schema is a rating system that classifies linked data schemas based on their level of adherence to best practices and standards for linked data. A 5-star linked data schema is the highest level of adherence and signifies a fully open and accessible schema that meets all the recommended standards for linked data. A 5-star linked data schema should be designed with a clear structure and expressivity to facilitate data sharing, reuse, and interoperability across different domains and applications. Additionally, it should provide adequate documentation and support for data producers and consumers, as well as adhere to open licensing and governance models. Overall, a 5-star linked data schema provides a high level of confidence in data quality and enhances data discoverability and reuse, making it a valuable asset for data scientists and other data professionals.
