### Daten.Cafe - Data Literacy

Daten.Cafe wants to provide basic knowledge in data literacy in a simple way. Free access to the application and the results form the basis for this. The application allows learning and practicing the concepts also on (modern) smartphones and tablets. Data literacy means being able to understand and deal with data. Using data in different contexts helps to make informed decisions. 

Data literacy is a skill that everyone should have, since data plays an important role in many areas of our lives. 

Data describes processes in our real environment. We can collect data ourselves, for example by recording how many steps we take in a day and how many calories we consume. These data can give us clues about how to promote our health.
Data about our behavior and activities is also collected by other entities - what music we listen to, what items we order online, what places we go.

All of this data can be used in different ways, including healthcare, business, and science.

Data literacy helps us make the right choices in our everyday decisions. And data literacy helps us assess what data about us and our behavior is available to other entities and what it can be used for.

### Who? All of us!

Data literacy plays an important role in the political context. Nowadays, many political decisions are made based on data, whether it's in elections, public surveys, or the evaluation of government measures. Through data literacy, the population can understand and evaluate the data basis of political decisions. This allows them to better decide which politicians or parties represent their views and which measures should be supported or rejected. Data literacy also enables people to recognize and refute misinformation and misleading data from political actors. Data literacy is also an important aspect in science. Data is collected and analyzed in many areas of science, whether it's in medicine, biology, physics, or other disciplines. Data literacy doesn't mean that you have to be a math expert. It's about understanding the basics of how data works, how to read charts and graphs, and how to interpret data in a way that makes sense to you. It's important to note that data can be manipulated or biased, so it's important to be critical when looking at data. Overall, data literacy can help you make better decisions in daily life and help you understand the world around you




### Why

Data literacy is important for personal and professional development. In many fields of work, skills in data analysis and visualization are increasingly in demand, and good data literacy can prove to be a valuable asset. Furthermore, better data literacy can help to understand and address problems and challenges in society. It is therefore important that the general public has access to data literacy training and resources. Governments, companies, and nonprofit organizations should work together to promote data literacy in society and ensure that everyone has access to the tools and resources they need to become data literate. Overall, data literacy is an important aspect of the modern world and a necessary skill for anyone who wants to be successful in today's society.
