### Daten.Cafe - Data Literacy

Daten.Cafe aims to provide basic knowledge in data literacy in a simple way. Free access to the application and sharable results are essential concepts. The application is not mobile-first, but at least mobile-compatiple, allowing learning and practicing of concepts on (modern) smartphones. Data literacy means the ability to understand and handle data. It's about how data can be used in different contexts to make informed decisions. Data literacy is a skill that everyone should have, as data plays an important role in many areas of our lives. In today's world, we generate a lot of data. This can include information on how we use our phones, how much we move, or even how much money we spend. Data is also used in many areas such as healthcare, economy, and science. Through data literacy, you can use data to make informed decisions. For example, if you're trying to lose weight, you can track your daily steps or calorie intake using an app. You can use this data to see if you're making progress towards your goal. Data literacy is also important in healthcare. Your doctor can use data such as your blood pressure or cholesterol levels to determine if you're at increased risk for certain diseases. By understanding this data, you can make lifestyle changes that may help reduce your risk.




### Who? All of us!

Data literacy plays an important role in the political context. Nowadays, many political decisions are made based on data, whether it's in elections, public surveys, or the evaluation of government measures. Through data literacy, the population can understand and evaluate the data basis of political decisions. This allows them to better decide which politicians or parties represent their views and which measures should be supported or rejected. Data literacy also enables people to recognize and refute misinformation and misleading data from political actors. Data literacy is also an important aspect in science. Data is collected and analyzed in many areas of science, whether it's in medicine, biology, physics, or other disciplines. Data literacy doesn't mean that you have to be a math expert. It's about understanding the basics of how data works, how to read charts and graphs, and how to interpret data in a way that makes sense to you. It's important to note that data can be manipulated or biased, so it's important to be critical when looking at data. Overall, data literacy can help you make better decisions in daily life and help you understand the world around you
