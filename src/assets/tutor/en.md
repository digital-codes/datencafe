the workspace has 2 regions. The flow editor to the left or top (on mobile) and the visualization
pane to the right or bottom. You create your workflow in the flow editor.

#### Toolbar

The toolbar provides you with all required utilities, in particular:

<img src="/img/tutor/toolbar-empty.png" class="wide">

  * ![](/img/tutor/help.png) Help
  * ![](/img/tutor/editStory.png) Edit story
  * ![](/img/tutor/upload.png) Upload workflow 
  * ![](/img/tutor/download.png) Download workflow 
  * ![](/img/tutor/trash.png) Clear 
  * ![](/img/tutor/newItem.png) New workflow item 

#### Flow

On your first visit you might want to start with an example story from the [story page](/stories). 
Download a story to your computer and upload it to the Workspace with the toolbar *upload*

This is how story1 flow looks like: ![](/stories/story1.png)

You can inspect and modify the example or start an entirely new flow. (Click the *trash* button for a fresh start.) 


Select item(s) from toolbar *new item*. Item will appear on the flow pane.
Click and drag items accros.

Drag the background to move view. Use mouse scroll-ctrl or touch guestures
to zoom in and out. 

Long click on item will open context menu. Options will be from 

 * Configure
 * Connect
 * Delete

![](/img/tutor/node-long-click.png)

Not all options will be available on all items.

Actual configuration options depend on node type, example *random generator*

![](/img/tutor/node-config.png)

You may connect first, or configure first, doesn't matter. 

Click *connect* to start a connection. Move the mouse a bit away from the source node. 
An intermediate connection line should appear.

![](/img/tutor/edge-connect-in-progress.png)

Move to the target node and click.

You might be asked which port to connect to. Select A or B
![](/img/tutor/edge-connect-final.png)

When done, you should see a new connection
![](/img/tutor/edge-connect-finish.png)

When you add a visualization element (one of the *plot* items), it will be added to the visualization pane.
You can match flow items and visualization items by their names.

A very small flow with two output elements would look like so, for example:

![](/img/tutor/miniflow.png)


![](/img/tutor/chartplot.png)

![](/img/tutor/tableplot.png)

Scroll the visualization pane to see all charts.

 * Click ![](/img/tutor/editStory.png) to add a description to your story. 
 * You can download your flow and story with ![](/img/tutor/download.png). The file contains all information, so
you may share it with other e.g. by email. We also collect interesting stories. Check the story page ![](/img/tutor/stories.png) to see other work.
