Implementing the Adaptive Areal Elimination (AAE) algorithm using Turf.js or gdal.js for geospatial anonymization requires a combination of different steps, including data preprocessing, spatial analysis, and anonymization. Here's an outline of the approach you can follow using Turf.js:

    Preprocessing:
        Read and parse the GPS tracks and environmental sensor data.
        Transform the data into Turf.js-compatible geometries and features.

    Spatial Analysis:
        Perform spatial operations to aggregate or generalize the geometries based on desired granularity (e.g., street level).
        Utilize Turf.js functions such as turf.buffer to create buffer zones around the data points.
        Merge or dissolve overlapping buffers to eliminate redundant areas.

    Anonymization:
        Modify or generalize the timestamps to the desired granularity (e.g., hour).
        Remove or perturb any sensitive environmental sensor data, if necessary.

    Output:
        Export the anonymized GPS tracks and environmental sensor data in the desired format.

Here's a sample code snippet illustrating how you can perform some of these steps using Turf.js for a simplified version of the AAE algorithm:
