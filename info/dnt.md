You can detect the "Do Not Track" (DNT) setting in JavaScript by accessing the navigator object and checking the value of the doNotTrack property.

The doNotTrack property returns one of three possible values:

    "1": Indicates that the user has enabled the DNT setting in their browser.
    "0": Indicates that the user has not enabled the DNT setting in their browser.
    "null": Indicates that the browser does not support the DNT setting.

Here's an example code snippet that checks for the DNT setting:

python

if (navigator.doNotTrack == "1") {
  // DNT is enabled
} else {
  // DNT is not enabled
}
